# diagonal-difference

Hackerrank challenges : Calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

## Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

### Sample Input

```
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```
### Sample Output

15

## Explanation

### The primary diagonal is:
```
11
   5
     -12
```
Sum across the primary diagonal: `11 + 5 - 12 = 4`

### The secondary diagonal is:
```
     4
   5
10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: `4 + 5 + 10 = 19`
Difference: `|4 - 19| = 15`
